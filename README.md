# -LSTM-Driven-Predictive-Maintenance-System-for-Industrial-Machinery
Our system aims to precisely predict the probability of maintenance for specific components of industrial machinery by leveraging historical sensor data, machine and component identifiers, failure events, and maintenance records. This enables proactive maintenance strategies, minimizing operational disruptions.
